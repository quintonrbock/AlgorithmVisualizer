# Algorithm Visualizer

**A Java-based interactive tool that visually demonstrates sorting algorithms in real time.**

---

## Overview

This application brings sorting algorithms to life by animating the insertion sort process. With adjustable speed and array size controls, you can see every comparison and swap as it happens. Itâ€™s an ideal project for anyone interested in understanding algorithm behavior through visual feedback.

## Features

- **Real-Time Animation:** Watch the insertion sort algorithm in action with dynamic visuals.
- **Speed Control:** Adjust the sorting speed to slow down or speed up the visualization.
- **Resizable Data Set:** Customize the number of elements to sort.
- **Color-Coded Visualization:** Different colors indicate elements being compared, swapped, or already sorted.

## Tech Stack

- **Java**
- **Swing & AWT** (for GUI and drawing)

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**
